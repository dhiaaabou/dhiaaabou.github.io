   <p>In this project, I  designed and created an interface and interactive website for film reviews. Users will be able to search or browse for films by name, genre, etc, view ratings and read about the film. users are able to filter or search for films in specific languages, lengths and movies.
In this project, I tried everything I learned in the field of design, from searches and user experience in more than one way, as well as scenario persona, in addition, I  designed products, based on client needs by Using my knowledge of UI and UX to create prototypes in Adobe XD,  HTML5, CSS3, and scripting languages (for example JQuery, PHP) to develop a working responsive data-driven prototype. 
Especially since the goal should meet client or user needs in all aspects, aesthetic, technical, and strategic.

   <p>I designed my portfolio using the HTML, CSS, jQuery programming languages, the web contains 6 different pages, each page has a different content, the field of practice and study experience is placed, and then I designed it with beautiful forms to give the user an idea of my skills
I chose to make the site designsimple and clear,  on the home page   I started the design of Top Nav in HTML by coding the menu without any complications I used the div and linked it to each other pages using (a href=”#”) for all the pages. The second div was for adding a large image and a simple sentence in my name as a heading, and the third section of the page was the footer with the rest of the page elements and social media logos <br>
 After completing the content of the first page of the list, images, paragraph, and footer, here   I linked the all div to the CSS page to give effects for each section such as colour, font type,  also margin and padding for each part of the content. And I used the hover as a good function on the top nav, the hover makes the users know which page they select and use
 Also, I used a (responsive) in java that will resize the website itself to preserve the user experience and look and feel across all devices with no irritation zooming, scrolling or resizing

Through implementing user-centred design processes I designed an app for mobile which aids the organisers in managing their football experience. In turn, this should make the overall experience smoother and more enjoyable for all players, organisers involved.
“Playing footy is the highlight of the week for most people.”
I initially designed the application and the content like the information and features needed by the users and App admin, from the ease of registration, use and access to information such as training places, timing and date, times of matches and tournaments, Buying the kit, and watching recording training and photos, also easy method payment for registration or shopping.

	<p>PORTRAY is a mobile Art app specific for photographers and painters, where you can share, find an art course, and follow the art events. 
A great way to stand out on PORTRAY is to share the artist's experience by creating his gallery or organising new events or following it.  That is, the application will help in more than one field, it will help promote the artist's works, increase his followers, reach his works to a large segment of people, and organize special exhibitions for his works to allow the opportunity to sell them, especially since the application can be developed through updating it and adding online marketing.  
On the other hand, the application is very important to provide the opportunity for talented or people who are looking for courses in the field of photography and drawing to find suitable courses for them, just the user needs to click on the option of the course, choose the course and apply.
The platform is built around content and community – making it a great idea for artists to engage with fans. People love to see the artist behind the work, and relate with the artists on a more personal and casual level by sending a direct message or chatting with them if the artist is online.
